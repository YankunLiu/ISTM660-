Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes",,A Traveler,

The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",Excellent hotel with good access to Venice,,Simon,

Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen.

Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.","Good option, great staff, quiet neighborhood",,Matthew,

From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest.

Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel.

We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!!

So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed.

The staff was consistently friendly and courteous. They had inexpensive activities like paddle boarding and kayaking available, of which we took advantage.

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described.

The road construction makes it fairly dangerous to get in to but once in the parking lot, it is it OK. While we were very impressed with everyone and everything during our first two days we were absolutely disgusted on Sunday. We left our room early Sunday and returned that evening to find our room had been left open ALL DAY - with dirty towels stacked in front of our door to keep it open and the bed left unmade - and ALL of our personal items (computers, phones, etc.) left out for anyone and everyone to peruse. And after being made aware we were still charged full price for our room with nothing more than a oh - sorry about that. It is a shamed that the week end crew with obviously NO management at all - could ruin the reputation of the regular staff who seemed to take some pride in the property.",Don't stay over the week end,,Dave,

The parking lot is a touch too small for the amount of rooms available, at times it may be difficult to find a parking spot if returning to the hotel late at night.

Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.,Web pics are fake! Run away!,,melissa,

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",Good location not the best place,,A Traveler,

There was a charge for parking your car at the hotel. Not very much, but a bit of a cheek when there's no real alternative. It's a bit like a restaurant charging you extra to use cutlery! It was also a bit tricky to find. There's a sign on the main road saying to turn right after 200 metres, but even if you're good at estimating distances and take the correct turning, you could still fail to find it!

Our room was on the side and had a terrible view of unsightly side of hotel next door. On reflection we should have asked to be moved but didn't bother as only there for a couple of days would definitely be worth paying more for the stunning view of port and cathedral. Had breakfast one day which was very good but quite expensive at 29 per person-would have been cheaper if we had included breakfast when we booked. Room facilities v good. Good wifi in room, lovely bed. Quite a long walk into town but very easy to hail a taxi if needed and not expensive at around 5.

The staff was very friendly and the service was great. Hotel is beautiful and our view of the port from our room was awesome. We were on the 6th floor in a partial sea view room. We only heard noise from the street one night and it wasn't bad. Great location for restaurants and night life. Its about a 15 minute walk to the old town/cathedral but the local 3 bus picks up near the front of the hotel and goes to the old town and to some great local beaches (Illetes). We had to figure this out for ourselves. Would have been nice if the hotel had more tourist info.,Beautiful hotel with great service,,Jennifer,

My room (classic) was fine, even though the layout of it was unfortunate, but the hotel is old and I guess they can't help the big pilar in middle... I booked through Hotels.com and asked for a quiet room. They remembered this and gave me a room on the street side, which was definitely quieter. In addition, the room had a separate door leading to the bedroom, which made the experience quieter. The breakfast was great and included sparkling wine. I enjoyed the fresh fruit and croissants! I wasn't that impressed by dinner, however. I had a steak, which was cooked as I asked, and the wine was good with it, but the list overall just wasn't to my taste. The pool area only have staff bringing out the lounge chair mattresses at 10am though, so if you're earlier than that you have to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that... this was a bit disappointing. Also while they serve you drinks and snacks to your lounge chair, they will not come to you to take your order - you have to go to the bar yourself. The fitness room is by the pool and separated by glass (leading to the pool). It's clean with towels, but there is no air conditioning and only 3 pieces of equipment. Overall a brilliant hotel!

I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything.

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.",Don't deserve 5 star rating!,,Judy,

Staff were extremely polite and helpful. The terrace overlooking the bay was ideal for relaxing for pre-dinner drinks or a snack.. Whilst the overall rating is high my only two very minor concerns to note are the prices for drink and food are rather high and the rooms are very well appointed with high quality bedding, linen and complimentary items but they can be dated. I would recommend a superior room with a balcony and view. You pay for what you get and from that perspective it was a high quality offering.

I travelled with my elderly mother and although the hotel has a lot of steps she was able to manage well. Staff are universally friendly and helpful. There is a small selection of bar meals which was very good. The cost of food and drinks is very reasonable considering the surroundings and service. We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily. The lay-out of the public areas around the foyer was very homely.....arranged in such a way with plants, rugs and large pieces of antique () furniture that each section felt like your own private sitting room and even when the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",autumn city break,,JW,

We had one evening meal which was delicious and the waiting staff were charming and attentive. The only criticism I have is that the wifi is not up to today's requirements. I am sure that many guests like me want to take advantage of Netflix which is now available in Europe and it was very frustrating to keep dropping the signal and having to wait or abandon the exercise entirely.

The male consierge was more than helpful when we arrived and upon departure. However, when I phoned before to confirm our reservation, older female consierge was not very pleasant and it was easy to pick her out when we were there in person. The younger female consierge was very helpful in contrast. The hotel lobby is large, elegant, and the hotel bar, bartender, were fantastic. The aperitivo was mostly breads with various topping, but good. The room itself, for a superior, was stuffy, overpriced, the bed was worn and too soft, the bathroom way too small for one person let along two people to move around in at the same time. Had to take the toilet paper off the roll to keep it dry while showering, water went everywhere. The refrigerator needed to be defrosted so wasn't cooling properly, which we used to keep our bottled water cool. Didn't need the mini bar so moved some things out to make room. Also the water wasn't working for a few hours that afternoon, for whatever reason, so no flushing, no washing hands, the maid came late in the afternoon to make up the room, not her fault though.","Old hotel , superior room way overpriced",,Littlebits,

After he proposed, we knew we wanted to have our wedding there. We had to book it over a year in advance because we wanted the last Saturday in April, but it was definitely worth the wait. Lisa, the in-house wedding concierge, was fantastic to work with. The food was absolutely spectacular, and it was served family-style instead of buffet, so none of our guests had to wait and watch while other guests got their food. The only downside was that we had to end the reception at 11pm, even though we would have loved to keep the party going.",,,Angie,

Initially, it was difficult to get a hold of someone to set up tours and discuss booking, but I believe this was because the staff was in flux at the time. Once Sabrina began handling our event, it was smooth sailing. Sabrina was very patient while my fiance and I went over the contract with a fine-toothed comb. She was able to address all of our concerns, answered all of our questions, and was very accommodating. When we booked the venue, we knew we had chosen the right place.Our day of coordinator was Michelle who was top-notch. I first met her at our menu tasting; she's charming, kind, and knowledgeable. I felt I could ask her the smallest/stupidest questions. I did most of the planning long-distance so prompt e-mails were important to me. Michelle and I were able to communicate most things through e-mail, and she did a great job making sure I didn't forget anything. On the day of the wedding, I honestly did not worry about a thing. I had such a wonderful time and it's because Michelle took care of everything. She helped make it an event to remember.My guests were impressed with the decor at the Citizen - I had many compliments on how beautiful and elegant the setting was. The terrace, along with the Capitol Building in the background, is breathtaking. I heard many people say that the food was fantastic, and one person said it was the best wedding food he's ever had. The guests also loved how each room is unique. The Reservations Manager, Megan, was also very easy to work with and allowed me to change many things, even at the last minute. We were in the Governor's Suite for the wedding, and the room is, of course, fabulous.My only critiques would be that there is no free wi-fi, but you can sign up for the Joy of Life Club and get free wi-fi that way. Parking can also be a concern, especially if you are part of the wedding party and need to go to and fro. But we all managed. Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our wedding and feel the Citizen Hotel did a fantastic job. Thank you!",,,geminix03,

He wrote the book How Great Companies get their Mojo from Maslow. The Citizen Hotel helped move me a bit up the pyramid, but being in Sacramento couldn't fully bring me to self-actualization. Oh well, can't have everything. It's an old downtown bank turned boutique hotel with dark reds and blacks and great drawings and political cartoons along the wall. The best is the black and white pic of a young buff Arnold Schwarzenegger, shirtless and in speedos, flexing with a group of bridesmaids in the women's bathroom in the parlor. The room was spacious, swanky, sophisticated. Dripping with old school charm and modern day luxuries. An Apple-lovers haven -- iPhone docks, macs in the business center. Dual shower heads, decent products, sitting room with a second flat screen TV (although I learned I had the ADA room). Steamer instead of an iron (LOVE), roomy, cozy, great bed, decent mini-bar.

The tented 7th floor terrace with a view of the capitol is exquisite to the point that minimal decorations are necessary. The food is local and sustainable and tasted every bit as good as during our tasting at the Grange. The food at the cocktail hour got especially rave reviews. The hotel put guests with children on the same floor as the terrace, so some families put their kids to bed and then were able to return to the reception to dance!

The T.V. only had about four channels and the water in the shower was barely warm. The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals , one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me. Next time I go to Ithaca, I may have to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget. Do I think it was worth the money No!

We left for the day and when we returned at night we found that the sewage backup has been cleared but no one cleaned the bathroom or made the room afterward. So we ended up CLEANING THE SHOWER TUB OURSELVES in order to be ready for dinner in time. When we confronted the staff bout it, the guy behind the desk offered to send a cleaning crew, which we declined because it was too late. And then for some reason the lady behind him got an attitude and started telling us it's our fault that the room wasn't cleaned because *she* thought we already checked out. Why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room that we prepaid for, she couldn't say. We went on to find out that TV and the iron did not work.
